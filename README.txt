Final Game
Author: James Foster

This game is a 2D adventure platformer with a couple of different enemies and levels it contains the features below and can be found on the website cs.uct.ac.za/~fstjam001/. Thanks to all the collaboraters and for downloading my first game! Be kind.

1. Jumping 
-Gravity, an initital velocity , terminal velocity and deceleration mean the jump is parabolic and as realistic as possible 

2. PowerUps
-There are powerUps that can be collected and are represented by a pink box. These power ups allow the character to gain better weapons throughout the game. The character need on run over the box to collect the weapon.

3.Checkpoints
-There are invisible checkpoints at  certain parts of the game that ensure that if the character is killed then the user does not need to play from the beginning.

4. Shooting
-The character can shoot at a fixed level and with an unlimited ammunition but a limited fire rate.

5.Enemies
-There are two different types of enemies, one static and one moving. The static enemies is the turret that fires when the character is within a certain range or steps on a trigger box.The dynamic enemies are the giant penguins armed with ak47s. they will chase the player and fire when the player comes into view.Gravity applies to these enemies and they change directions when a wall is encountered and they are in wander mode.

6.Flying
-The character can fly, using the space to gain alititude, for  a limited amount of time when the character jums into the bat sprite.Flying can be used to travel over enemies or get to hard to reach places but is only possible for  a few seconds after the character has jumped into the bat.

7.Sound
-This game includes a backing soundtrack as well as laser gunshot noises for when the character or enemy fires.

8.Switches
-There are switches used in places that turn the turret/sentry guns off in order for the character to get through.

9. Thorn
-There are certain areas where if the character jumps onto them the character will die and respawn at the last checkpoint.

Note: The dynamic enemies take 3 shots from the character to die.
Note: There is a boss fight at the end of the game 
Note: You may resize the screens width but only on start up
Note: Sometimes the tiled map editor cannot pick up the resources if the directory has changed. To solve just open the map called "StartLevelTest.tmx" in the "core" assests and "Desktops" bin and save again in the same directories.Please contact me if you cannot resolve this issue.
